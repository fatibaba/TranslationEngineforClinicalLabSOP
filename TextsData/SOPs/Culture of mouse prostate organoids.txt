Culture of mouse prostate organoids
In tissue culture hood, combine 200 ?L 10x collagenase / hyaluronidase mixture with 1.8 mL DMEM/F12 + 5% FBS. 
Place in 37?C water bath until ready to use.
Resect mouse prostates and transfer to sterile petri dish containing cold PBS for dissection6.
Using a dissecting microscope, fine forceps, and sharp scissors, remove residual fat from prostate tissue.
Fill 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with 1 mL of diluted pre-warmed collagenase / hyaluronidase solution and transfer prostate tissue into the tube.
Using small, sharp sterile scissors, macerate the prostate tissue by rapidly opening and closing the scissors inside the tube to cut the tissue into small pieces.
Fill the tube with an additional 50 ?L of collagenase / hyaluronidase solution until almost full.
Incubate in 37?C incubator for 3 hours. 
Incubate in 34-37?C incubator for 3 hours. 
Incubate in -32 to -37?C incubator for 3 hours. 
(Tip: The Eppendorf tube may be placed on its side in a sterile
